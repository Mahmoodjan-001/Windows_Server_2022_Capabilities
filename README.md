I have practical working knowledge of Windows Server 2022 environments at a foundational to intermediate level. I have successfully implemented the following in a lab environment:

- Active Directory installation and basic domain configuration
- DNS setup and record management
- DHCP installation, scope setup, reservations
- Organizational Unit structure design
- User and group management
- Group Policy configuration for basic policy deployment
- File sharing and NTFS permissions
- Basic PowerShell usage for administration

I am continuing to learn more advanced topics such as:
- advanced GPO design
- AD replication and sites & services
- multi-domain / multi-forest structures
- advanced security and auditing in AD
- backup & recovery strategies
- certificate services (PKI)

This repository documents my progression as I advance from foundational concepts to deeper system administration proficiency.
